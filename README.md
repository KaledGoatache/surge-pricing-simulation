**Dynamic Pricing Algorithm**

---

This notebook simulates a surge pricing algorithm where prices dynamically adjust based on demand and capacity constraints. The goal is to understand how dynamic pricing can maximize revenue and approach the optimal price equilibrium. <br> 
**NB: Inspired in a taxi service pricing, capacity and demand for each of the 20 hour periods**
 <br> <br> 
 **Key takeaways** 
 <br> From an economic analysis point of view :<br>
- When **demand exceeds capacity**, price and marginal cost rise thus surge pricing occurs.
- Profit margin does not always increase because congestion raises costs .
- Optimal alpha (α) balances responsiveness with stability.
- The firm faces diminishing returns when capacity is fully used.
